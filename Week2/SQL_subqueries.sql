-- SUBQUERIES & NESTED LOGIC PRACTICE
-- =========================================================

-- Q1) Scalar subquery (AVG benchmark):
--     List products priced above the overall average product price.
--     Return product_id, name, price.

SELECT product_id, name, price
FROM products
WHERE price > (SELECT AVG(price) FROM products);

-- Q2) Scalar subquery (MAX within category):
--     Find the most expensive product(s) in the 'Beans' category.
--     (Return all ties if more than one product shares the max price.)
--     Return product_id, name, price.
-- Find the most expensive product(s) in the 'Beans' category

SELECT p.product_id, p.name, p.price
FROM products p
WHERE p.category_id = (
    SELECT category_id 
    FROM categories 
    WHERE name = 'Beans'
)
AND p.price = (
    SELECT MAX(price)
    FROM products
    WHERE category_id = (
        SELECT category_id 
        FROM categories 
        WHERE name = 'Beans'
    )
);

-- Q3) List subquery (IN with nested lookup):
--     List customers who have purchased at least one product in the 'Merch' category.
--     Return customer_id, first_name, last_name.
--     Hint: Use a subquery to find the category_id for 'Merch', then a subquery to find product_ids.

SELECT DISTINCT
    c.customer_id,
    c.first_name,
    c.last_name
FROM customers c
WHERE c.customer_id IN (
    SELECT o.customer_id
    FROM orders o
    WHERE o.order_id IN (
        SELECT oi.order_id
        FROM order_items oi
        WHERE oi.product_id IN (
            SELECT p.product_id
            FROM products p
            WHERE p.category_id IN (
                SELECT category_id
                FROM categories
                WHERE name = 'Merch'
            )
        )
    )
);

-- Q4) List subquery (NOT IN / anti-join logic):
--     List products that have never been ordered (their product_id never appears in order_items).
--     Return product_id, name, price.

SELECT
    product_id,
    name,
    price
FROM products
WHERE product_id NOT IN (
    SELECT product_id
    FROM order_items
);


-- Q5) Table subquery (derived table + compare to overall average):
--     Build a derived table that computes total_units_sold per product
--     (SUM(order_items.quantity) grouped by product_id).
--     Then return only products whose total_units_sold is greater than the
--     average total_units_sold across all products.
--     Return product_id, product_name, total_units_sold.
SELECT
    dt.product_id,
    p.name AS product_name,
    dt.total_units_sold
FROM (
    SELECT
        product_id,
        SUM(quantity) AS total_units_sold
    FROM order_items
    GROUP BY product_id
) dt
JOIN products p
    ON dt.product_id = p.product_id
WHERE dt.total_units_sold > (
    SELECT AVG(product_totals.total_units_sold)
    FROM (
        SELECT
            product_id,
            SUM(quantity) AS total_units_sold
        FROM order_items
        GROUP BY product_id
    ) product_totals
);
