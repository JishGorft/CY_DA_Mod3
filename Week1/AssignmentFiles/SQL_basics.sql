-- directly below it. Keep your work; you'll submit this file.
-- =========================================================

-- Q1) List all products (show product name and price), sorted by price descending.
SELECT name, price FROM products ORDER BY price DESC;

-- Q2) Show all customers who live in the city of 'Lihue'.
select first_name, last_name, city FROM customers WHERE city = 'Lihue';

-- Q3) Return the first 5 orders by earliest order_datetime (order_id, order_datetime).
SELECT order_id, order_datetime FROM orders ORDER BY order_datetime ASC LIMIT 5;

-- Q4) Find all products with the word 'Latte' in the name.
SELECT name FROM products WHERE name LIKE '%Latte%';

-- Q5) Show distinct payment methods used in the dataset.
SELECT DISTINCT payment_method FROM orders;

-- Q6) For each store, list its name and city/state (one row per store).
SELECT name, city, state FROM stores;

-- Q7) From orders, show order_id, status, and a computed column total_items
--     that counts how many items are in each order.
-- --- --- WTF?

-- Q8) Show orders placed on '2025-09-04' (any time that day).
SELECT order_id, order_datetime FROM orders WHERE order_datetime > '2025-09-04' AND order_datetime < '2025-09-05';
-- Not entirely certain why WHERE order_datetime = '2025-09-04' does't work. Maybe instead LIKE '%2025-09-04'

-- Q9) Return the top 3 most expensive products (price, name).
SELECT price, name FROM products ORDER BY price DESC LIMIT 3;

-- Q10) Show customer full names as a single column 'customer_name'
--      in the format "Last, First".
SELECT concat(last_name, ', ', first_name) AS customer_name FROM customers
